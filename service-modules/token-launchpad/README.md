# Token Launchpad

If you've created a token that you'd like to sell to the public instead of just doing a free airdrop, then you'll want to use the Token Launchpad. This module allows you to set a sale where users have the opportunity to purchase your tokens within a pre-defined time window and price.

As a reminder, anybody can create a token and airdrop it to Soonaverse users. Only those who want to do a public sale through the Token Launchpad will need to click the "Begin Process" button and go through the KYC process with our partner:

_\*Note: The Soonaverse team will have no access to your private KYC information. All of that is solely held by our KYC partner._

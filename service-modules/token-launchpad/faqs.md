# FAQs

**Why do I have to claim tokens although I claimed all the airdrops?**

* This new "claim" will move your tokens from the Soonaverse to the verified SMR address on your member profile.

**How can I verify a Token ID?**

* Go to the "Token Info" page of the desired token, click the Shimmer symbol in the "network" area in the top right. This brings you to the Shimmer explorer where you have to scroll down to "Transaction Payload" and open "Foundry" on the Transaction Output side and look for the "Foundry ID", which is the token ID.

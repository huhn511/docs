# Soonaverse DAO

Currently the Soonaverse is being built by a private company, but our strategy is to reduce the concentration of all parts of the organization until it's a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).&#x20;

As a company and future DAO, here are some things you should know:

### Founding Principles

1. "All Voting MUST be FREE and Securely ON-Chain"
2. “DAOs must have immutable TRUST and REPUTATION”
3. “An anonymous voice is STILL A VOICE and members must be HEARD”

### Commitments

* The Soonaverse is committed to building the foundation for organizations that enable DAOs and embrace personal sovereignty - where every person and community has the power to vote, the power to choose.
* The Soonaverse will remove the “dysfunction from decentralization” and steer communities towards its better angels through trust and reputation.
* The Soonaverse prioritizes the will of DAOs and its communities by creating equitable systems of proposal management. We believe that members should make their case, give people their vote and let the best ideas win.
* We will always strive to be a place for experimentation and innovation, but not at the cost of our members.
* The Soonaverse will be built with the most reliable and advanced decentralization technologies available, once they are PROVEN to be safe.
* We will embrace transparency and honesty in our approaches, especially when it comes to transitioning from centralized to decentralized technologies.
* The SOON token is a means to govern the platform and is woven into the very fabric of the system. We avoid fees wherever possible, especially when it comes to voting.
* We will create tokenomics that keep the platform funded and thriving to support the ecosystem, our members, and the DAOs we are creating.

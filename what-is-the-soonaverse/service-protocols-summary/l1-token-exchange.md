# L1 Token Exchange

This isn't your normal centralized exchange. Instead of requiring users to deposit their assets into the position and then create positions, the L1 Token Exchange uses the Shimmer network so users only deposit assets into the platform when they create an order. If the order is fulfilled automatically then the assets are only in custody for less than 5 seconds.

After scripting (basic smart contract functionality) is available on the Shimmer network, we'll be able to fully decentralize the entire exchange. This exchange will be the first of its kind, allowing it the ability to bring fees down to literally zero since there's no transaction costs involved.

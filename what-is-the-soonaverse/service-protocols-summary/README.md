# Service Protocols Summary

Even though there's a foundation of feeless core modules that drive the Soonaverse, developers also have the opportunity to launch projects that generate fee revenue. These are called service modules. A portion of all fees generated by these modules will be distributed back to SOON token holders in the form of SPDRs ([Token Utility](../../token/token-utility.md)).

The Soonaverse currently leverages three service modules to interweave and build on core module functionality to enable the connective structures that DAOs require to build, innovate, interoperate, and scale:

1. Token Launchpad
2. Token Exchange
3. Iotabee DEX

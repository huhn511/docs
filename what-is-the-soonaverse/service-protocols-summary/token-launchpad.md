# Token LaunchPad

The Token LaunchPad uses ISCP to distribute new tokens and raise liquidity for DAOs. It enables DAOâ€™s to quickly enter production and initiate token launches without start-up capital. This ability to discover and fund the latest upcoming cryptocurrency projects by buying their tokens at a special pre-sales price before it enters the market is a key attribute of the Token LaunchPad. After the pre-sale, pre-allocated tokens will integrate with a network of trusted DEX partners to enable investors and traders to freely trade immediately after the fundraising round.

As a customizable decentralized token marketplace, the Token LaunchPad will enable DAOs to control bidding and pricing strategies, token distribution and vesting, price evaluation triggers, price discovery, final and real-time settlement, and lock up timings. Building on the IOTA protocol provides DAOs with a multi-asset ledger that includes smart contracts, with seamless cross-chain asset transfers. This is coupled with an unrivaled Tokenization Framework that runs on the feeless, secure, immutable Tangle.

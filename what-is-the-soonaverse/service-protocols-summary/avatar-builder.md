Users will mint thematic avatars based on the Soonanaut theme, but additional astronaut characters and alien species character sets will be available for sale through the platform. Artists who develop externally created avatars (species) NFT collections and merchandise NFT collections must submit their work as SIPs (Soonaverse Improvement Proposals) to the Soonaverse DAO and the DAO will vote on implementing them as eligible avatars.

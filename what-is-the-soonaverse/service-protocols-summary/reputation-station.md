# Reputation Station

The Reputation Station allows a member to enshrine their contributions and achievements into a quantifiable “reputation” that can be immutably expressed through badges (the types of tasks completed) and experience tokens (the value of those tasks). This reputation is given out through Awards.

Badges are created by individual DAOs. They define the tasks and value of the “work to be done”, which is expressed in experience tokens (XP). XP is created via a token foundry with a long timelock condition (a type of output on the Shimmer network). The XP is tied to the successful completion of the task and is awarded along with the badge when the task is completed.

Badges and XP are always retained as a record of the tasks accomplished.

XP can be rewarded only through activities and/or actions. It cannot be purchased, which makes it a scarce resource that only active and productive members of the DAO can accumulate.

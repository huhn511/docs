# Reputation Station

The Reputation Station allows a member to enshrine their contributions and achievements into a quantifiable “reputation” that can be immutably expressed through badges (the types of tasks completed) and tokens (the value of those tasks). This reputation is given out through Awards.

Badges are created by individual spaces. They define the tasks and value of the “work to be done”, which is expressed in tokens. Tokens can be created via a token foundry bought bought on the open market. The tokens are tied to the successful completion of the task and is awarded along with the badge when the task is completed.

Badges and tokens are always retained as a record of the tasks accomplished.

Badges can be rewarded only through activities and/or actions. It cannot be purchased, which makes it a scarce resource that only active and productive members of the space can accumulate.

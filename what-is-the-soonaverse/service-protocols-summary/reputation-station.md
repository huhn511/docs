# Reputation Station

The Reputation Station allows a member to enshrine their contributions and achievements into a quantifiable “reputation” that can be immutably expressed through badges (the types of tasks completed) and experience tokens (the value of those tasks).

Badges are created by individual DAOs. They define the tasks and value of the “work to be done”, which is expressed in experience tokens (XP). XP is created via an ISCP smart contract, which controls the wrapping of the native DAO token (DAO in this example) into XP. Each XP token is equivalent to 1 native token (DAO). The XP is tied to the successful completion of the task and is awarded along with the badge when the task is completed.

Badges are always retained as a record of the tasks accomplished. However, the XP they earned can either be converted back to the DAO token or retained and collected as “reputation” on the platform.

XP can be rewarded only through activities and/or actions, programmed into the smart contract the community decides to use. It cannot be purchased, which makes it a scarce resource that only active and productive members of the DAO can accumulate.

Members who have completed work for DAOs and have accrued XP have the ability to pledge this tokenized reputation to pretty much anything in order to drum up interest in a project. This provides a valuable resource for community members of all engagement levels to improve the security of voting proposals, maintain anonymity while retaining a record of accomplishments, and reward activities that perpetuate the health and well being of the DAO’s mission and vision.

**A critical attribute of this approach is that it provides a standard for reputation measurement across all DAOs.** A person may have done significant treasury management work at one DAO, but has no simple way to convert or convey that work to another DAO. The Reputation Station solves this problem.

If voters in both DAOs agree to allow DAO XP to convert (at an exchange rate of their choosing) their reputation becomes an active currency they can leverage to boost their own accomplishments or to pledge to other members within the DAO. This “Reputation Ledger” will be a catalyst to help people jumpstart their journey into working full time within every DAO they have an established connection with.

Members will essentially own their reputation and accomplishments like private property they can leverage to pledge, share, and profit by earning a yield off their reputation. The opportunity for integrations with the metaverse and other services is immense. Reputation can be the foundation block to increase users credibility and access (Human Resources, review sites, access to platforms and more).

**The Reputation Station dApp’s UI/UX** is designed to create gamefied user experiences that invite regular interaction from users.

Customizable badges and avatars present an opportunity for artists and creators to produce customized avatars, badges and merchandise. Improving engagement within DAO communities through shared assets and collectible items.

Users will mint thematic avatars based on the Soonanaut theme (Fig 1.0) but additional astronaut characters and alien species character sets will be available for sale through the platform. Artists who develop externally created avatars (species) NFT collections and merchandise NFT collections must submit their work as SIPs (Soonaverse Improvement Proposals) to the Soonaverse DAO and the DAO will vote on implementing them. Badges on the other hand, can be made by anyone on demand since they're DAO specific.

This keeps the avatars and the merchandise used to dress them up scarce, and encourages badge creation and distribution inside a DAO.

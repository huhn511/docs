# Space Creation

Space creation is at the foundation of the entire Soonaverse.

Spaces are interactive community hubs where members who are interested in working toward a common goal can get together and organize themselves. This can start as a simple project with the option to evolve into a DAO.

Not familiar with DAOs? Check out one of our recent articles:

We allow anybody in the world to spin up a space for free on the Soonaverse.

Members can join a space, discuss topics, build and vote on proposals, and reward fellow members for tasks completed and their contributions to the group.



_Here's an example of a space on the Soonaverse:_

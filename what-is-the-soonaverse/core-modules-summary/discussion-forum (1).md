# Discussion Forum

This module allows DAOs to have discussions that are auditable and anchored on-tangle; storing early planning discussions and vision articulation; genesis transaction and treasury planning; governance and formal voting discussions.

It's simply a forum within a space that allows guardians and members to communicate about important issues. There's no need to recreate Discord. The Discussion Forum module will facilitate lively communication and debates on the proposals and treasury allocations that can be immutably referenced.&#x20;

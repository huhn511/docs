# Treasury Management

The Treasury Management module uses the Secure Feeless Voting module and smart contracts to deposit newly minted tokens into a multi-signature wallet controlled by predefined addresses with customized signature rules.

Successful companies invest and effectively deploy capital from the corporate treasury. Likewise, community run DAOs share a similar imperative. DAOs require the stability and sustainability of a dynamic system that can adapt to the volatile fluctuations of the market. Some DAOs will need the complexity of risk and portfolio management, others simple hedging capabilities, yield farming and airdrops. This module caters to all users allowing both predefined templates or fully customizable settings to enable DAOs of any size to operate smoothly.

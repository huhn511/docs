# Feeless On-Chain Voting

We fundamentally believe all DAO voting should be free and securely on-chain. Unlike traditional on-chain voting systems, our voting module will utilize the Tangle for feeless voting and will allow for more innovative voting structures. The module will initially be based on token holdings, but we will include more options as the technology progresses.

This new type of feeless voting will utilize the Hornet participation plugin, and we're working with the IOTA Foundation to deliver this.



Right now we don't have feeless on-chain voting active, but any space on the Soonaverse can create a Proposal for either their guardians or all members to vote on using the current Soonaverse architecture:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

What's more is that the creator of the proposal has more options than just one member = one vote. This is one of the scenarios where the Reputation Ledger comes into play. You have the following voting types on Proposals:

* **Member - One Vote:** Each member of the space gets one vote.
* **XP Reputation - Space:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has in the space.
* **XP Reputation - Selected Badges:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has for selected badges.



Voting is one of the most important aspect of any organization, whether is be shareholders in a company or citizens of a nation state. Our Feeless On-Chain Voting core module will elevate voting to a new level in the digital world.

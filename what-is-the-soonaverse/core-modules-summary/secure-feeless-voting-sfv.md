# Secure Feeless Voting (SFV)

We fundamentally believe all DAO voting should be free and securely on-chain. Unlike traditional on-chain voting systems, the SFV module utilizes the Tangle and ISCP to support secure, feeless voting and can therefore allow more innovative voting structures for members. The module will include traditional plurality and majority win models, but can also be customized to allow weighted and quadratic models or delegated and liquid democracy voting systems.

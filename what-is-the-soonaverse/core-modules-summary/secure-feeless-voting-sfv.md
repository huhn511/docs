# Feeless On-Chain Voting

We fundamentally believe all DAO voting should be free and securely on-chain. Unlike traditional on-chain voting systems, our voting module will utilize the Tangle and ISCP to support secure, feeless voting and can therefore allow more innovative voting structures for members. The module will include traditional plurality and majority win models, but can also be customized to allow weighted and quadratic models or delegated and liquid democracy voting systems.

Right now, any space on the Soonaverse can create a Proposal for either their guardian or all members to vote on:

What's more is that the creator of the proposal has more options than just one member = one vote. This is one of the scenarios where the Reputation Ledger comes into play. You have the following voting types on Proposals:

* **Member - One Vote:** Each member of the space gets one vote.
* **XP Reputation - Space:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has in the space.
* **XP Reputation - Space + Connection:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has in the space & connections (See ["Alliances and the Interoperability of DAOs"](https://soonlabs.medium.com/alliances-and-the-interoperability-of-daos-73c7c010b037) article for more info on Connections).
* **XP Reputation - Selected Badges:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has for selected badges.

Voting is one of the most important aspect of any organization, whether is be shareholders in a company or citizens of a nation state. Our Feeless On-Chain Voting core module elevates voting to a new level in the digital world.

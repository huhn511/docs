# Feeless On-Chain Voting

We fundamentally believe all DAO voting should be free and securely on-chain. Unlike traditional on-chain voting systems, our voting module utilizes the Tangle and ISCP to support secure, feeless voting and can therefore allow more innovative voting structures for members. The module will include traditional plurality and majority win models, but can also be customized to allow weighted and quadratic models or delegated and liquid democracy voting systems.

Talk about the wyas we currently vote and the reputation and how it's integral to, wha t we currenlt ywe havce and futre possiblites.&#x20;

We're loking at: quadratric voting, others that are recommended by community.

Scree4nshots of our voting screens and screnshots of how we do the voting. Feeless voting, that should be broguht out and tocuehd on whenever.

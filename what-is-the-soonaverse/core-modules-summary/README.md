# Core Modules Summary

The DoD is designed to make the creation of customized, feature-rich DAOs a “one click” process that takes minutes to set up and deploy. Utilizing the IOTA Smart Contract Protocol (ISCP), DoD provides DAO committee configuration options, a UI for apps, SDKs, and a library of smart contract templates. DAO templates will provide configurable Smart Contracts for governance and DAOs of all types, including traditional LLCs, community groups, non-profits, investors, governments and even venture capital DAOs.

The Soonaverse is a platform that allows communities to create and maintain DAOs on the IOTA network. It offers the infrastructure to connect DAOs via dApps, can interface with oracles, bridges, and smart contracts to realize the vision of a decentralized Web3 network.

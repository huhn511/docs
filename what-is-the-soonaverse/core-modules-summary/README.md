# Core Modules Summary

The feeless core modules of the Soonaverse are the foundation of the platform and rely on both centralized and decentralized components. Everything that can be decentralized through the IOTA and Shimmer networks has been. For example right now, all tokens and NFTs can, with a few clicks, become native assets on the Shimmer network. That means fully custody can be held by the user.

The core modules include:

* Space Creation
* Reputation Station
* Feeless On-Chain Voting
* DAO Token Deployment
* NFT Marketplace

As you can see, there are a lot of feeless core modules. This is by design. If the Soonaverse is going to succeed then it needs a strong feeless foundation that profitable service modules can be built upon.

# DAO Token Deployment

Most DAOs need a token to govern and coordinate their community, with this core module each token deployment achieves this goal, but also leverages the unique attributes of the IOTA and Shimmer networks. Users can now “spin up” their own token with ease, in a completely feeless process.

If a project wants to sell their tokens to the public via the Token Launchpad service module, then they can click the "Begin Process" button under the Token Sale Requirement box to begin the process of filling out KYC information.

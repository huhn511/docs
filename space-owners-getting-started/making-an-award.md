# Making an Award

An award is simply a combination of Experience Tokens (XP) with a Badge that is tied to the completion of a specific task, bounty, action etc.

Badges are rewarded to a contributor upon fulfillment of the assignment. Various smart contract templates will be provided in the future for communities to utilize.

To make an award for your space, go to the "Awards" tab inside your space:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png>)

From there, click the "+ New award" button:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1).png>)

Fill in all the fields, click the "Mint Avatar" button to create your badge, and then click the "Create award" button:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1) (1).png>)

After that you (or another Guardian) will click the "Approve" button:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (22) (1) (1).png>)

And just like that, someone can now participate in your award!

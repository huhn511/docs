# Building a Space

If you don't remember what a space is, [check it out here!](../the-basics/basic-terminology/spaces.md)

Building a space in the Soonaverse is incredibly easy! Just follow these steps:







_**If you're building a space that will be doing an NFT sale, make sure to verify your IOTA wallet!**_

We integrated the **Firefly** and **TanglePay** wallets in order to validate addresses that will be receiving funds from NFT sales. There’s a new section in all spaces called “Your wallet” with a button to “Verify wallet.” Before a space can create a collection, they must have a validated space wallet. This validation process is fully automated and involves sending a small amount of IOTA to an address to verify that the space owner has control of the keys, and then that amount is automatically sent back. After that, the space is eligible to create NFT collections and receive royalties.

_Please note that at this time, once an address is validated for a space, it cannot be changed. We did this for security reasons, so a rogue guardian can’t change the address without anyone knowing until it’s too late. We’ll introduce a feature in the future that enables guardians to vote on changing the validated address._

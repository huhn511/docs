# Building a Space

If you don't remember what a space is, [check it out here!](../the-basics/basic-terminology/spaces.md)

Building a space in the Soonaverse is incredibly easy! We'll take you through step by step!

First thing you'll want to do is go to [https://soonaverse.com/discover/spaces](https://soonaverse.com/discover/spaces), click the "Create new" dropdown button, and then choose "Space":

As you can see the setup for a space is pretty simple. You just need to do the following:

* Create a name for the space and give it a description (we support markdown, so you can add some cool formatting elements to it)
* Decide whether your space will be open for anybody to join or if you will be manually approving each new member who tries to join your space
* Upload an Avatar photo
* Upload a Banner photo
* Fill in the Networking section with any relevant links

After you complete those things you can click "Create space" and BAM! You have yourself a new space!

And here's what it looks like in the wild:

### _If you're building a space that will be doing an NFT sale, make sure to verify your IOTA wallet!_

We integrated the **Firefly** and **TanglePay** wallets in order to validate addresses that will be receiving funds from NFT sales. There’s a new section in all spaces called “Your wallet” with a button to “Verify wallet.” Please visit the [Verifying your IOTA Wallet](../all-users-getting-started/verifying-your-iota-wallet.md) page to learn more.

Before a space can create a collection, they must have a validated space wallet. This validation process is fully automated and involves sending a small amount of IOTA to an address to verify that the space owner has control of the keys, and then that amount is automatically sent back. After that, the space is eligible to create NFT collections and receive royalties.

_Please note that at this time, once an address is validated for a space, it cannot be changed. We did this for security reasons, so a rogue guardian can’t change the address without anyone knowing until it’s too late. We’ll introduce a feature in the future that enables guardians to vote on changing the validated address._

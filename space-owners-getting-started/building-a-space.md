# Building a Space

If you don't remember what a space is, [check it out here!](../the-basics/basic-terminology/spaces.md)

Building a space in the Soonaverse is incredibly easy! We'll take you through step by step!

The first thing you need to do is participate in any award on the Soonaverse. You can do that by following these instructions: [Participating in an Award](../all-users-getting-started/participating-in-an-award.md). This will give you some XP. You need XP to create a space.

The next thing you'll want to do is go to [https://soonaverse.com/discover/spaces](https://soonaverse.com/discover/spaces), click the "Create new" dropdown button, and then choose "Space":

As you can see the setup for a space is pretty simple. You just need to do the following:

* Create a name for the space and give it a description (we support markdown, so you can add some cool formatting elements to it)
* Decide whether your space will be open for anybody to join or if you will be manually approving each new member who tries to join your space
* Upload an Avatar photo
* Upload a Banner photo
  * _Note from the developers: "Banner is set to "object-fit: cover" meaning: The replaced content is sized to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. If the object's aspect ratio does not match the aspect ratio of its box, then the object will be clipped to fit. I would target the widest browser window breakpoint (browsers width 1900px +) = ratio of the banner img 37:8. For smaller screens it will cut the sides of the image but it stays perfect for your targeted browser resolution. n3tsu is a good example, the main logo is centred so it doesn't matter if the banner is cropped"_
* Fill in the Networking section with any relevant links

After you complete those things you can click "Create space" and BAM! You have yourself a new space!

### _If you're building a space that will be doing a Token or NFT sale, make sure to verify your IOTA and Shimmer wallets!_

We integrated the **Firefly** and **TanglePay** wallets in order to validate addresses that will be receiving funds from the Token or NFT sales. There’s a new section in all spaces called “Your wallet” with a button to “Verify wallet.” Please visit the [Verifying your Wallet](../all-users-getting-started/verifying-your-wallets.md) page to learn more.

Before a space can create a collection, they must have a validated space wallet. This validation process is fully automated and involves sending a small amount of IOTA or Shimmer to an address to verify that the space owner has control of the keys, and then that amount is automatically sent back. After that, the space is eligible to create tokens or NFT collections and receive royalties.

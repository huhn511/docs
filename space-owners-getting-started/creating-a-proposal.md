# Creating a Proposal

Proposals enable members of a space to contribute ideas that will guide the project forward. These proposals are authored by member(s) and then voted on by members of that Space.

Voting can be configured by the author(s) to limit or control who can participate in a vote based on their badges and reputation. If the vote is passed, the space will implement the change or initiative outlined in the proposal.



To create the proposal for your space, simply go to the Proposals tab:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (29) (1).png>)

And choose "+ New proposal":

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1) (1).png>)

You'll see a lot of prompts that you can fill out. Here's an example of a completed proposal form ready to be created:

_A few things to take note of on the image above:_

Not only can you choose between letting either Guardians or Members vote, but you have the following voting types on Proposals:

* **Member - One Vote:** Each member of the space gets one vote.
* **XP Reputation - Space:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has in the space.
* **XP Reputation - Space + Connection:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has in the space & connections (See ["Alliances and the Interoperability of DAOs"](https://soonlabs.medium.com/alliances-and-the-interoperability-of-daos-73c7c010b037) article for more info on Connections).
* **XP Reputation - Selected Badges:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has for selected badges.

After you've reviewed everything, pressed the "Create Proposal" button, and signed the transaction in your MetaMask, you'll see the final review screen.

Here is where a Guardian can review and then either "Approve" or "Decline" the proposal to go to a vote. In this case one of the Guardian's will click "Approve" and then sign the transaction in MetaMask:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (27) (1).png>)

The proposal is approved and now it's just waiting to get started. As you can see, voting will start in 3 minutes:

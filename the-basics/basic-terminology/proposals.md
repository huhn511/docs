# Proposals

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

In the Soonaverse, voting is free and securely on-chain.

Proposals enable members of a space to contribute ideas that will guide the project forward. These proposals are authored by member(s), approved by Guardians, and then voted on by members of that Space.

What's more is that the creator of the proposal has more options than just one member = one vote. This is one of the scenarios where the Reputation Ledger comes into play. You have the following voting types on Proposals:

* **Member - One Vote:** Each member of the space gets one vote.
* **XP Reputation - Space:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has in the space.
* **XP Reputation - Space + Connection:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has in the space & connections (See ["Alliances and the Interoperability of DAOs"](https://soonlabs.medium.com/alliances-and-the-interoperability-of-daos-73c7c010b037) article for more info on Connections).
* **XP Reputation - Selected Badges:** Votes are weighted based on total amount of XP a member has for selected badges.

# Experience Tokens (XP)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (26) (1) (1) (1).png>)

A unique feature of the platform is that reputation has an actual “value” through XP, and can be converted into DAO tokens and/or used to leverage influence in any DAO on the platform.

How does this happen? Let me explain:

Badges are created by individual spaces. They define the tasks and value of the “work to be done”, which is expressed in XP. XP is created via an ISCP smart contract, which controls the wrapping of the native DAO token (DAO in this example) into XP. Each XP token is equivalent to 1 native token (DAO). The XP is tied to the successful completion of the task and is awarded along with the badge when the task is completed.

Badges are always retained as a record of the tasks accomplished. However, the XP they earned can either be converted back to the DAO token or retained and collected as “reputation” on the platform.

The only way to be awarded XP is by completing actions and/or activities that are programmed into the smart contract. These specific actions and activities are decided upon by the community involved. It cannot be purchased, which makes it a scarce resource that only active and productive members of the DAO can accumulate.

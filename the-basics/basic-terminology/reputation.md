# Reputation

Reputation is what you’ve accomplished in the communities you chose to belong to. Reputation is a foundational component to any system because it gives your behavior, history and allows other users to quickly connect, trust, and interpret your intentions.

A Soonaverse reputation is essentially YOU and what you’ve done in any and every DAO, every badge, every award that you’ve ever received, immutable and enshrined in the reputation ledger. Your reputation tells people what you want them to know about you, even if they don’t know who YOU really are.

An additional component to the Soonaverse is that reputation has an actual “value” through XP and can be converted into DAO tokens and/or used to leverage influence in any DAO on the platform.

Reputation is what you’ve accomplished in the communities (spaces) you’ve chosen to belong to. Reputation is a foundational component of the Soonaverse platform, it provides a history of your behavior, achievements and allows other users to quickly connect, trust, and interpret your intentions.

A Soonaverse reputation is essentially you and what you’ve done in any and every Space/DAO, every badge, every award that you’ve ever received, immutable and enshrined in the reputation ledger. Your reputation tells people what you want them to know about you, even if they don’t know who you really are.

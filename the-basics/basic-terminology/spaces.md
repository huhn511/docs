A Space is an interactive community hub on the Soonaverse where members who are interested in working toward a common goal can get together and organize themselves. This can start as a simple project with the option to evolve into a DAO.

The recent addition of the NFT Marketplace provides new functionality to allow DAOs, projects, and individual creators to sell NFTs via Collections within a Space.

Members can join a space, discuss topics, build and vote on proposals, reward fellow members for tasks completed and their contributions to the group. Spaces can be public or private.

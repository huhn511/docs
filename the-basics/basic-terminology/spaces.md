# Spaces

A Space is an interactive community hub where members who are interested in working toward a common goal can get together and organize themselves. This can start as a simple project with the option to evolve into a DAO.

Members can join a space, discuss topics, build and vote on proposals, and reward fellow members for tasks completed and their contributions to the group. Awards are represented in the form of XP and Badges. Spaces can be public or private.

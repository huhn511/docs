# Awards

An award is simply a combination of Experience Tokens (XP) with a Badge that is tied to the completion of a specific task, bounty, action etc.

Badges are rewarded to a contributor upon fulfillment of the assignment. Various smart contract templates will be provided in the future for communities to utilize.

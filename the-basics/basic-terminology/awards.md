# Awards

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (19) (1) (1).png>)

An award is simply a combination of Experience Tokens (XP) with a Badge that is tied to the completion of a specific task, bounty, action etc.

Badges are awarded to a contributor upon fulfillment of the assignment.

XP will be, in the near future, created via a token foundry with a long timelock condition (a type of output on the Shimmer network).

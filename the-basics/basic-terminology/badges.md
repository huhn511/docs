Badges are earned through Awards.

Badges can be bundled with Experience Tokens (XP) and convey a member's skill, competency, and commitment which helps establish reputation within the DAO/Soonaverse.

Individual DAOs have the autonomy to create their own badges inside their communities as well as accepting badges from other DAOs.

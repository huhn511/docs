Members are individuals who want to join or build Space/DAO, create an NFT Collection, or simply buy and trade NFTs. Becoming a Member involves setting up a MetaMask wallet/account that is linked to your profile (in the future this will be linked to Digital Identity). A memberâ€™s profile becomes their homepage where they can show off their badges, contributions, and digital property.

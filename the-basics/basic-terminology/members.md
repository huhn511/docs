# Members

Members are individuals who join a Space. An individual is simply an account on MetaMask (but in the future will be linked to Digital Identity) and can be affiliated with multiple spaces.

Soon members will be able to receive Soonaverse Experience Tokens (XP) and collect various badges as NTTs (Non-transferable Non-Fungible Tokens).

These XP Tokens and Badges can be presented within various DAOs and will be verifiable through the Tangle.

Badges help establish REPUTATION in the Soonaverse. In the future, Badges will return a financial YIELDâ€¦SOON!

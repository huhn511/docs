# The SoonLabs Manifesto

SoonLabs is a collaboration between dedicated professionals, skilled in navigating the constant tension between invention and production to find ways to create, build, and get things done. We have different backgrounds, skills, and experiences, but share a singular goal, a shared vision, a common mantra - together we can build the impossible.

Our current “impossible” is building a more equitable world through decentralization. A world where centralized systems have NOT concentrated society’s influence, power and wealth into the hands of an infinitesimally small number of individuals and organizations.

Decentralization will enable us to avoid cronyism and chaos. Where we are what we’ve done, and how we’re SEEN is based on merit not image, value not celebrity.

Like the DAOs we create, we believe that contributions should be judged without bias, blind to color, class, and creed, where every vote counts, where “we” is stronger than “me”, and organizations are equal and flat because that’s the way they should be.

We believe that privacy isn’t just a cloak, it's a shield, and an anonymous voice is still a voice. DAOs must have trust, they must have reputation for members to create meaningful connections, so when people gather they become makers not mobs.

Your voice matters and NO ONE should demand a fee for expressing your opinion, no one should force you to pay to exercise your right to vote, decentralization must be an enabler not a wall.

Our DAOs will bring the change the world needs, by spreading the power of every decision across 7.7 billion points of humanity, where everyone's an influencer, because everyone has influence.

Ask WHO we need. We’ll say, YOU.

Ask HOW can it be done. We’ll say, TOGETHER.

Ask WHERE it will happen. We’ll say, RIGHT BEFORE YOU EYES.

And then ask us WHEN. No, ask us WEN and we will say SOON, because THAT is always our answer.

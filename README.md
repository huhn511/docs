# What is the Soonaverse?

## Overview

The Soonaverse ([https://soonaverse.com/](https://soonaverse.com)) is a decentralized platform for communities, enabling the seamless creation, management, and interoperability of DAOs.

DAO-on-Demand (DoD) enables the “one-click” setup of DAOs and provides components that simplify complex DAO operations through an integrated set of feeless core modules. This includes the Secure Feeless Voting module, the first feeless, on-chain voting system in the industry. The Soonaverse also includes 2 innovative and feature-enhancing service modules; the Token LaunchPad and the Reputation Station.

The above diagram depicts the DoD’s 4 feeless core modules and the 2 service modules that comprise the entire Soonaverse platform:

These DoD core modules include:

* **Discussion Forum** - Communication platform integration support for DAO founders.
* **Secure Feeless Voting** - Voting without the onerous fee structures imposed by other solutions.
* **DAO Token Deployment** - Streamlined minting of DAO tokens for DAO’s of all sizes and complexities.
* **Treasury Management** - Control and definition of monetary semantics for the DAO with predefined templates that minimize complexity.

The Soonaverse Reputation Station and Token LaunchPad service modules further extend the capabilities of DAOs operating within the platform.

The Reputation Station allows achievements and awards to be enshrined in a “Reputation Ledger” driving community engagement internally, but can also be shared between DAOs, improving interoperability across Soonaverse.

The Token LaunchPad allows DAOs to generate liquidity by minting and exchanging tokens seamlessly via partner integrations.

This all-in-one decentralized approach offers an unrivaled level of performance and empowerment, built on the feeless infrastructure of the IOTA network.

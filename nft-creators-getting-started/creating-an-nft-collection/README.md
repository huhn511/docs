# Creating an NFT Collection

An artist should be able to focus all their energy into their art. They shouldn’t have to worry about the intricacies of setting up their own NFT launchpad. With the new NFT Builder, artists no longer need to worry about things like IPFS, creating their own smart contracts, setting up a dedicated website, etc. We simplify the entire process, plus you have the added benefit of your work being available within the Soonaverse and the 10,000+ and growing Soonaverse community waiting to engage with your artwork.



Here's a brief walkthrough video:

The NFT Builder will initially allow artists to choose and upload three different types of NFT collections: Classic NFTs, Generated NFTs, and SFTs.

_**Classic NFTs**_ are the most straightforward in that you upload your images, they’re all visible right away, and people can browse through your collection and purchase what they like. Simply upload and sell!

_**Generated NFTs**_ add a little mystery into the mix. The buyer won’t know what their NFT looks like until they mint it. The owner of the collection has the ability to put in a placeholder image for the entire collection to give the buyer an idea of what the NFT may look like, but their mint will still be a surprise. This is the most common type of NFT (it’s what IOTABOTs did).

_**SFTs**_ (Semi-Fungible Tokens) are a hybrid between the two approaches above. The collection creator can create a classic NFT, but they have the option to multiply them. For example, they can upload 10 images, but each image will have a quantity of 100. This is a relatively new term in the space, but a good real world example of this approach would be baseball or football trading cards.

NFTs in the Soonaverse are grouped into collections. The collection controls some overall settings, and within that collection, you'll load NFTs:

As you can see, there's a section in your space that allows you to see your NFT collections. All you need to do to add a new collection is to click the "+ New Collection" button:

You'll being to fill out some fields:

You'll want to choose a name and description of your collection, the collection type, and a royalty %.

By default, **all** initial sales and royalties will go to the space that created the collection, but the creator has the ability to point royalties to another space. This means that an artist can help a space raise funds via an NFT sale and receive a royalty on both the initial sale and all future secondary market sales for their work. This royalty percentage is fully customizable and under the control of the creator. No additional fees from the platform are involved, unlike other platforms like OpenSea which tax both the creator and buyers.

A few other things to note on the "Create new collections page":

* There's a place for you to link your website, Twitter, and Discord.
* Discounts are possible for members of your space
* A banner for the collection can be uploaded
* A specific type of category can be chosen (Collectible, PFP, Photography, Animation, 3D, etc.)
* There's different types of collection setups that will determined which groups are allowed to purchase your NFTs. These can be either:
  * Everyone in the Soonaverse
  * Only the Guardians of your space
  * Only members of your space
  * Only members of your space with a specific badge

Once you've completed all the fields, you click the "Create collection" button at the bottom and the collection is created. After that a Guardian will need to click the "Approve Collection":

You are now able to upload NFTs to your new collection!

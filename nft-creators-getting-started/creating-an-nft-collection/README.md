# Creating an NFT Collection

An artist should be able to focus all their energy into their art. They shouldn’t have to worry about the intricacies of setting up their own NFT launchpad. With the new NFT Builder, artists no longer need to worry about things like IPFS, creating their own smart contracts, setting up a dedicated website, etc. We simplify the entire process, plus you have the added benefit of your work being available within the Soonaverse and the 10,000+ and growing Soonaverse community waiting to engage with your artwork.

The NFT Builder will initially allow artists to choose and upload three different types of NFT collections: Classic NFTs, Generated NFTs, and SFTs.

_**Classic NFTs**_ are the most straightforward in that you upload your images, they’re all visible right away, and people can browse through your collection and purchase what they like. Simply upload and sell!

_**Generated NFTs**_ add a little mystery into the mix. The buyer won’t know what their NFT looks like until they mint it. The owner of the collection has the ability to put in a placeholder image for the entire collection to give the buyer an idea of what the NFT may look like, but their mint will still be a surprise. This is the most common type of NFT (it’s what IOTABOTs did).

_**SFTs**_ (Semi-Fungible Tokens) are a hybrid between the two approaches above. The collection creator can create a classic NFT, but they have the option to multiply them. For example, they can upload 10 images, but each image will have a quantity of 100. This is a relatively new term in the space, but a good real world example of this approach would be baseball or football trading cards.

Write about how all NFTs start out as NFT Collections and then NFTs are added into the collection. So collection comes first with broad properties, then you stuff NFTs inside the collection.







By default, **all** initial sales and royalties will go to the space that created the collection, plus the creator has the ability to point royalties to another space. This means that an artist can help a space raise funds via an NFT sale and receive a royalty on both the initial sale and all future secondary market sales for their work. This royalty percentage is fully customizable and under the control of the creator. No additional fees from the platform are involved, unlike other platforms like OpenSea which tax both the creator and buyers.

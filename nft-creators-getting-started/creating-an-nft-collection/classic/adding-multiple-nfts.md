#### **Here's an in-depth tutorial on how to add multiple NFTs to a Classic Collection:**

On the "Create NFT" screen, you'll want to click the "Multiple" tab. This is where you can add multiple NFTs:

The first thing you need to do is upload all of your NFTs. You can do this by dragging and dropping the files into in the "Upload multiple images" box or you can click on the "Upload multiple images" box and select the files in your file explorer.

Once you've successfully uploaded your files (this can take several minutes depending on how many and how large your files are), click the "Generate CSV" button:

After you generate and download the CSV, open it in your preferred viewer. For this tutorial I'll be using Microsoft Excel. You'll notice when you open up the spreadsheet that the file names aren't in any type of order. Feel free to sort them how you please before inputting data. It won't affect anything when you go to reupload.

Fill in all of the cells applicable to you (_note that "price" is in IOTA and not MIOTA_):

After you've added all your information, save the CSV to your computer, and upload it:

For the next step we recommend you click the eye icon next to a few of your NFTs to spot check how the upload went. Check the image, properties, stats, etc.

Once you're comfortable with what's been uploaded, you can click the "Publish NFTs" button and sign the MetaMask transaction:

After you've created all your NFTs, all you need to do is click the "Publish Collection" button (**check out how each NFT is fully visible and has it's own "Buy now" button**):

_Please note that there's currently a 1 day waiting period from publishing the collection to the availability date of the collection. This is a safeguard to allow the community time to evaluate the project before it goes live. Additionally, it gives the system time to upload everything to IPFS._

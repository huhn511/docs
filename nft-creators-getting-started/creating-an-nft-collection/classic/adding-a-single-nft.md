#### **Here's an in-depth tutorial on how to add a single NFT to a Classic Collection:**

On the "Create NFT" screen, you'll notice that the "Single" tab is automatically defaulted to. This is where you can add a single NFT:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (33) (1) (1) (1).png>)

You want to fill out all of the fields and upload your NFT file:

* _**Name**_ - The name of this particular NFT.
* _**Description**_ - The description of this particular NFT.
* _You'll notice that the "Sales info" section is automatically populated with the information you provided when creating the NFT collection. You are free to change these fields if your strategy is to price each NFT differently._
* _**NFT Image**_ - This is where you'll upload your NFT (Available file types for NFTs: jpg, jpeg, png, webp, and mp4; The limit for each file is 100 MB).
* _**Properties**_ - You can add the properties of your NFT here.
* _**Stats**_ - You can add the stats of your NFT here.

Once you've filled everything out, you can click the "Create NFT" button, sign the MetaMask transaction, and your NFT will now show up in your collection:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (22) (1) (1).png>)

You can repeat the process above until you've created all your NFTs. After you've created all your NFTs, all you need to do is click the "Publish Collection" button:

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (27) (1) (1) (1).png>)

_Please note that there's currently a 1 day waiting period from publishing the collection to the availability date of the collection. This is a safeguard to allow the community time to evaluate the project before it goes live. Additionally, it gives the system time to upload everything to IPFS._

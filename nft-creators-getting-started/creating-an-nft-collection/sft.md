# SFT

SFTs (Semi-Fungible Tokens) are a hybrid between the two approaches above. The collection creator can create a classic NFT, but they have the option to multiply them. For example, they can upload 10 images, but each image will have a quantity of 100. This is a relatively new term in the space, but a good real world example of this approach would be baseball or football trading cards.

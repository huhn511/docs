# Generated

Generated NFTs add a little mystery into the mix. The buyer wonâ€™t know what their NFT looks like until they mint it. The owner of the collection has the ability to put in a placeholder image for the entire collection to give the buyer an idea of what the NFT may look like, but their mint will still be a surprise. This is the most common type of NFT.

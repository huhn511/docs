# Verifying the IOTA Wallet

With the new NFT Marketplace, you will be able to connect an IOTA address to your Space or Profile to allow you to buy and sell NFT’s.



Here's a brief walkthrough video:

All you need to do to verify your IOTA address is follow these 3 easy steps:

3\. Simply send the small amount of IOTA to that address and you’re done!



Once the verification is done, the amount will be returned to your wallet. Remember that you will need to re-stake your wallet balance, if necessary, once the amount is returned

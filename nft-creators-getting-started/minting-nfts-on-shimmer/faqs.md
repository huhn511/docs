# FAQs

**I want to mint my NFT collection on shimmer. What do I have to look out for?**

* No change of price after minting
* No change of discount (for now, but it is a requested feature that we're looking into)
* Not possible to add more NFTs to the collection, although it may not be "limited"
* Minting costs SMR per NFT minted (storage deposit)

MetaMask provides an easy and secure way to connect to blockchain-based applications. It generates passwords and keys on your device, so only you have access to your accounts and data.

The Soonaverse utilizes MetaMask for signing transactions. Instead of creating a profile with an email address and password that's stored on a centralized server, we allow our members to fully control their accounts.

MetaMask is available as a browser extension and as a mobile app. Check out the two tutorials for installing MetaMask on either:

* Desktop
* Mobile

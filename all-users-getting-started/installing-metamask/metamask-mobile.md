# MetaMask - Mobile

For this tutorial I will be using an Android phone, but the steps should be very similar for iPhone users. Start by going to the app store on your phone and searching for "Metamask".

Find the MetaMask app and click "Install":

Once it's installed, open the MetaMask app:

Click the "Get started" button:

From here you should have at least two options:

1. Import using Secret Recovery Phrase
2. Create a new wallet



_**If you've already created a MetaMask wallet on your desktop and you want to use the same Soonaverse accounts on both your desktop and mobile devices, then you can choose the "Import using Secret Recovery Phrase" prompt and follow the corresponding steps.**_



If you haven't created your MetaMask wallet yet, then you'll need to start from scratch! Follow these steps on your mobile device to create your new wallet:

1. Choose the "Create a new wallet" option
2. Choose either "No Thanks" or "I Agree" depending on how much you want to help the MetaMask team improve usability and user experience.
3. Create and confirm your password. Make sure to make it a strong one and follow proper password management so you don't forget it and it's always secure :thumbsup:
   1. After that you'll check the box agreeing that MetaMask can't recover this password for you.
   2. Click the "Create password" button
4. The security of your MetaMask wallet is so important! Please take a few minutes to watch the video and read about your Secret Recovery Phrase. We can't stress enough how crucial this part is to the crypto ecosystem as a whole. After you're done, you can click the "Start" button.
5. Grab a piece of paper and a pen/pencil and then click the "Start" button.
6. Type in your password or scan your fingerprint.
7. Click the "View" button to reveal your Secret Recovery Phrase
8. Write down the 12 words you see in that exact order on your piece of paper.
   1. Click the "Continue" button
9. Tap each word in the order that you wrote it down. The system is doing this test to confirm you actually wrote it down, because remember, if you lose these words, you lose access to your wallet!
   1. Once you get all the words in the right order, you'll be able to click the "Complete Backup" button.
10. Congratulations! You did it, you have a MetaMask wallet! You can now click the "Done" button.



You'll notice that after you click the "Done" button, it takes you to your wallet screen and at the top it says "Ethereum Main Network":

You'll be taken to a screen where you can add the extension to your browser (click the "Add to" button):

You may get an additional permissions box that pops up, click the "Add" button:

You should notice a cool little fox icon in the upper right hand our browser now. That's your MetaMask mascot. He's there to show you that you've successfully installed the MetaMask browser extension.&#x20;

For any additional options feel free to click "Okay" for right now:

You'll be presented with two options:

1. You've used MetaMask in the past and you'd like to import an existing wallet
2. You, regardless of whether or not you've used MetaMask in the past, would like to create a new wallet

For our tutorial we're going to "Create a Wallet":

A screen may prompt asking if you'd like to send additional data. We will be choosing "No Thanks" in this tutorial:

On this next screen you'll want to create and confirm your password. Make sure to make it a strong one and follow proper password management so you don't forget it and it's always secure :thumbsup:

Check the "Terms of Use" box and then click the "Create" button:

The security of your MetaMask wallet is so important! Please take a few minutes to watch the video and read about your Secret Recovery Phrase. We can't stress enough how crucial this part is to the crypto ecosystem as a whole.

After you're done, you can click the "Next" button:

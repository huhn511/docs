# Profile - Desktop

Having a cool customized profile is a big part of the fun in the Soonaverse! Let's walk through the steps that will take you from just having a regular MetaMask account to having a full blown Soonaverse member profile!



Head on over to [https://soonaverse.com/](https://soonaverse.com/) and click the "Connect" button in the upper right hand corner of the page to connect your MetaMask account:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

After you've connected, click your address in the upper right hand corner of the window and choose "My Profile":

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Click the pencil icon next to your @ handle:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (4) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Change your Display Name to one you think is awesome and add a brief description about yourself:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Here's the fun part! Click the "Mint Avatar" button to mint your free avatar that will act as your profile picture. In the future we'll enable new super rare premium avatar species and avatar collectibles/accessories that can all be traded. And underneath the Networking section, you can link your GitHub, Twitter, and Discord accounts:

**And just like that your a member of the Soonaverse with a complete profile!**

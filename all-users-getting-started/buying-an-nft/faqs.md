# FAQs

**I withdrew an NFT to firefly. Where is it?**

* Firefly does not yet have the capability to view NFTs and thus to send them from a wallet. The NFTS are not gone, and can be traded once firefly is updated. You may wish to wait to withdraw until then.

**Can't buy a particular NFT. "Collection not migrated to the decentralized network"...**

* As an artist mints an NFT collection, the collection will become temporarily unavailable and give this error. Once all have finished been minted, trade of the NFTs in the collection will resume.

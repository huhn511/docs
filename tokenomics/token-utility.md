# Token Utility

Holders of the SOON token will have a say in the Soonaverse protocol governance and the Soonaverse Treasury. The treasury will be initially funded with 25% of the entire token supply.



**While the core modules are free to use, the service protocols have built-in fee generating mechanisms** that continuously provide additional funds to the Soonaverse Treasury:

We will begin with 2 service protocols and continuously add more on top of our foundation feeless core modules:

1. **Token Launchpad:** A small fee is charged to each person participating in the funding round.
2. **Avatar Builder:** Avatars and merchandise are a critical component in establishing personalization and user affinity. To entice the highest quality collaborators the majority of the fees generated by the following acts will go to the artist and a minority portion will go to the Soonaverse Treasury.
   1. Minting and reselling avatars
   2. Minting and reselling merchandise

_Note: Avatars and merchandise must be minted inside of the Soonaverse ecosystem._



All members will be able to utilize the 7 core modules without fees. However, **we have engineered a unique staking feature as a support mechanism to prevent malicious actors from exploiting the feeless nature of the modules and spamming the network:**

* To create DAOs and awards on the Soonaverse platform, a user must stake and lock a certain number of SOON tokens.
* While the tokens are staked, the user will be able to create a certain amount of DAOs and awards each week.
* This amount is directly related to the amount of SOON tokens they have staked.

Additionally, the token supply will be inflationary with a higher inflation rate in the first few years and tapering off to a low inflation rate in perpetuity.

* Inflationary rewards will be given to both node operators of our feeless ISCP chain and SOON token stakers.
* Stakers have a minimum lock up period of one month, but have the option to increase that locking period linearly up to 12 months, and by doing so can increase their allocation of the inflation rewards up to 2x.

As a native IOTA DAO on Demand solution, we will leverage the feeless capabilities of the IOTA protocol and eliminate transactional fees for DAO creation, voting, and governance. The goal is to immediately differentiate ourselves in the market and drive high volume utilization of DAO creation to quickly propagate the network.

Our intention is to drive communities to our default suite of higher margin service modules such as the Launchpad and Avatar Builder products. The likelihood of enabling and profiting from the next “unicorn” is orders of magnitude higher in this vibrant marketplace model.

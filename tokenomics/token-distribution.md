**Launchpad:** Fairly distribute tokens to the public. All these funds, similar to the seed sale, will be used to continue the growth of the Soonaverse.

**Seed:** The seed sale will be used to hire more developers, pay for code audits, and all other cumulative costs.

**Core Contributors:** These tokens are allocated for the founding team and other critical team members.

**Treasury:** This will be used as a cushion to fund future development costs until the service protocol fee revenue is large enough to become self-sustaining.

**Community Adoption Incentives:** A large pool of tokens will be set aside to reward early community members, encourage the use of the platform, and incentivize liquidity of the SOON token.

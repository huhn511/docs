# Token Distribution

The distribution of the fixed 100,000,000 SOON supply is as follows:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)

_**Launchpad**_: Fairly distribute tokens to the public. All these funds will be used to continue the growth of the Soonaverse.

_**CEX Liquidity**_: Engage with a market maker to ensure the SOON token is completely liquid across all centralized exchanges itâ€™s listed on.

_**Core Contributors**_: These tokens are allocated for the founding team and other critical team members.

_**Treasury**_: This will be staked and revenue generated through SPDRs will be used to fund future development costs and third party service modules.

_**Community Adoption Incentives**_: 10% of the token supply will be airdropped to all SoonLabs Genesis NFT holders. The remaining 30% will be used to reward stakers and liquidity providers over a period of 3 years. Staking will begin once smart contracts are live.



_Of the 20% allocated to core contributors, only 15% goes to the founding team. The other 5% has been and will continue to be allocated to early contributors of the Soonaverse. This core contributor allocation is subject to a one year lock up period (starting on May 27th, 2022) followed up by a one year linear vesting period._

_During this lockup time the core contributor tokens will be staked, but with limitations. These staked tokens can only receive SPDRs and not token emissions from the 30% Community Adoption Incentives allocation._

**Seed:** The seed sale will be used to hire more developers, pay for code audits, and all other cumulative costs.

**Core Contributors:** These tokens are allocated for the founding team and other critical team members.

**Treasury:** This will be used as a cushion to fund future development costs until the service protocol fee revenue is large enough to become self-sustaining.

**Launchpad:** We will be utilizing our Token Launchpad to fairly distribute 10M tokens to the public. These will not be subject to lockup.

**Adoption Incentives:** A large pool of tokens will be set aside to reward early community members of the protocol. This includes receiving SOON tokens for doing the following:

* Providing liquidity for the SOON/IOTA pair on TangleSea and other DEXs
* Creating an award
* Receiving an award
* Pledging reputation to a project
* Funding a project on the Launchpad

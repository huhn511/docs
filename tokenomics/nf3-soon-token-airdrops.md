If you want to see your airdrop amounts, then you can enter your MetaMask address into this spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p\_UMC8Fmw78bMK8cRqrXkXe-59nHQK8fSoJwLypRun4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p\_UMC8Fmw78bMK8cRqrXkXe-59nHQK8fSoJwLypRun4/edit?usp=sharing)

If you don't know your MetaMask address, then all you need to do is go to your Soonaverse profile, and pull it from the URL:

After a snapshot is completed and processed, the SOON tokens will be available to claim on your Soonaverse Profile. Once claimed, you can trade them on the Token Exchange.

If you don't want to pay the 1 MIOTA fee to claim your SOON tokens then you can wait until they are minted on the Shimmer network. After that the claiming process will have storage deposits ([https://wiki.iota.org/introduction/develop/explanations/what\_is\_stardust/storage\_deposit](https://wiki.iota.org/introduction/develop/explanations/what\_is\_stardust/storage\_deposit)) integrated and you will get that small fee refunded.
